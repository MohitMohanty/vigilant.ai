# 👁️🤖 Real-Time Vision Intelligence (Prompt-Driven AI)

> **Can AI sense when it’s being watched?**  
This project demonstrates a **real-time, prompt-driven Vision Intelligence system** that doesn’t just detect objects — it **understands scenes, intent, and behavior** using Vision-Language Models.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This application connects a live camera feed to a **Vision-Language Model (VLM)** and allows users to **dynamically change prompts** to control what the AI analyzes — *without retraining or restarting the system*.

The same camera can instantly switch roles:
- From general scene understanding  
- To behavior detection  
- To safety monitoring  
- To security surveillance  

All controlled purely through **natural-language prompts**.

---

## 🎥 What Happens in the Demo

1. The AI first **describes the live scene** in front of the camera in natural language  
2. The prompt is then changed in real time to:  
   > *“Check if the person is using a smartphone”*  
3. The AI immediately adapts and **correctly detects smartphone usage**  
4. No model retraining, no rule changes — just **prompt-based intelligence**

## 🔍 Why This Is Different

Traditional systems rely on fixed object detection and hard-coded rules.

This system enables:
- 🔄 Dynamic task switching  
- 🧠 Contextual reasoning  
- 📹 Per-camera custom intelligence  
- 📝 Real-time text alerts  

---

## 🧪 Example Prompt-Driven Use Cases

- 🦺 Alert if a worker is not wearing safety equipment  
- 🔥 Detect fire, smoke, or sparks  
- 📵 Detect mobile phone usage in restricted zones  
- 🚧 Identify unsafe behavior near machinery  
- 👥 Detect overcrowding or abnormal movement  
- 🚫 Alert if someone enters a restricted area  
- 🛡️ Identify suspicious perimeter activity

## 🏭 Potential Application Areas

- Industrial safety & compliance  
- Manufacturing & warehouses  
- Smart surveillance  
- Defense & perimeter security  
- Critical infrastructure  
- Airports & high-security zones
